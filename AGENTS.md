## Directory Inspection for Resume

To inspect the current directory structure and file states on Windows, run the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File -Name | Where-Object { $_ -notmatch 'venv|pycache|.git|.pytest_cache' }
```

Parse the output to become fully aware of the actual, current file and directory structure. This step is mandatory for every resume.

## Generic Agent Bootstrap Algorithm

1. List all files in the project directory (excluding venv, pycache, .git, .pytest_cache) using the following PowerShell command:

   ```powershell
   Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File -Name | Where-Object { $_ -notmatch 'venv|pycache|.git|.pytest_cache' }
   ```

2. Read the contents all agent-bootstrap.md files.
3. Follow the instructions in `agent-bootstrap.md` to bootstrap the agent, step by step, as described in the document.
4. Execute each step in order, ensuring all requirements and setup tasks are completed before proceeding to the next.
5. Repeat the process for any additional bootstrap or setup instructions found in other relevant documentation files.
